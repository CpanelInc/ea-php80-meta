Package %{scl_name} provides the PHP scripting language as a Software
Collection.  For more information about Software Collections, see
scl(1).  By installing the %{scl_name} collection, you will get a
minimal set of packages to have a working PHP.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'php'

Software Collections allows use of applications which are not located
in the filesystem root hierarchy but are present in an alternative
location, which is %{_scl_root} in case of the %{scl_name}
collection.

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it
easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also
offers built-in database integration for several commercial and
non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

The %{?scl_prefix}php package provides the module (often referred to as mod_php)
which adds support for the PHP language to Apache HTTP server.

The %{?scl_prefix}php-fpm package provides the FastCGI process manager
which adds support for the PHP language to FastCGI compatible servers.

FastCGI process manager (php-fpm) listens on local network soket
(by default port 9000).

When working with %{scl_name} collection, use the "scl" utility (see
scl(1) for usage) to enable the scl environment properly.

Configuration for the %{scl_name} software collection is located under %{_sysconfdir}.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with argument --arg within %{scl_name} software collections
  environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'php'
  Run php from %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run interactive shell where %{scl_name} software collection is enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man php'
  Show man pages for php command, which is part of the %{scl_name} software
  collection.

%if 0%{?rhel} >= 7
systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}php-fpm
%else
service %{?scl_prefix}php-fpm start
%endif
  Starts the php-fpm server from %{scl_name} software collection.
